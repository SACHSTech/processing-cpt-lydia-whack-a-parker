# Prison Escape

# Game Objective

Collect all 5 keys and escape… or get caught and lose. Prison Escape is a two-player minigame where you could play as the officer or the prisoner in the setting of a jail maze. Controlled by the arrow keys, and WASD, respectively, the winner is determined by whichever player first meets their objective. As the prisoner, you must navigate and collect all 5 keys within the maze and escape through one of two doors to achieve victory. On the other hand, the prison guard must tag the prisoner before they escape. 
Sounds easy, but the guard broke his leg so he walks super slow. Luckily, the prisoner has been spending his cell days getting built so he can run a bit lot faster than the guard. 


# Gameplay Mechanics

Being in a maze, the walls cannot be travelled through. If the prisoner tries to escape without collecting all 5 keys, it is impossible to win. 


# Scoring

As the prisoner, your success is measured by the keys your collect. Collect a total of 5 keys and escape to win. 


# Limitations

Once someone has won, that’s it! It’s a short minigame and if players would like to replay or switch roles, they can press RUN again. Both players are controlled through one keyboard.
