# Prison Escape

# Game Objective

<font color="orange">

Collect all 6 keys and escape… or get caught and lose. Prison Escape is a two-player minigame where you could play as the officer or the prisoner in the setting of a jail maze. As the prisoner, you must navigate and collect all 6 keys within the maze and escape through one of two doors to achieve victory. On the other hand, the prison guard must tag the prisoner before they escape. 

The prison suffered an earthquake recently. Some of the walls have fallen down. These walls will not block you; you can run over the. These are the darker walls. 

Also, a wall fell on the guard so he broke his leg and he walks super slow. Luckily, the prisoner has been spending his cell days getting built so he can run a lot faster than the guard.

# Gameplay Mechanics

<font color="orange">

Being in a maze, the walls cannot be travelled through. If the prisoner tries to escape without collecting all 5 keys, it is impossible to win. The prisoner is controlled by WASD, and the guard is controlled by a virtual arrow keypad on the screen. The winner is determined by whichever player first meets their objective.

# Scoring

As the prisoner, your success is measured by the keys you collect. Collect a total of 5 keys and escape to win.

# Limitations

Once someone has won, that’s it! It’s a short minigame and if players would like to replay or switch roles, they can press RUN again. Both players are controlled through one keyboard.
