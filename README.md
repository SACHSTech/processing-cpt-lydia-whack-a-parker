# Prison Escape

Prison Escape is a 2-player minigame where the police officer tries to stop the prisoner from escaping. You can play as either the prisoner (using WASD) or the prison guard (arrow keys). The prisoner must collect all 5 keys and escape to win, while the prison guard must tag the prisoner to win. Whichever role, prisoner or prisoin guard, wins the best out of three, wins the game.
